          A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website,
          the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.

          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation.
          It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the
          building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

          Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to transform
          the presentation of a Web Pages as well as many ostensibly nonweb environments.

          CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text,
          the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what
          background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and
          screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

          JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
          web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
          you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
          scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
          layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
          much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

          The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook.
          It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with
          significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

          In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as
          independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when
          assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.
